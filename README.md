# ITHS_Webb_AdvancedWebdesign_FinalProject
Final project in "Advanced Webbdesign"
The task was to create a website using all that we learned during the course. This included html5, css, sass, javascript, responsive webdesign, Material Design, Flexible Box layout etc. I chose to create history quiz with a timer in the browsers tab. This is not complete, only the 2 first subjects are working ("Svenska kungar" and "Musikhistoria").
